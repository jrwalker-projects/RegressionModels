# RegressionModels
Regression models course project

The programming assignment for the Regression Models course was to look at the mtcars dataset included with R and to answer two questions:
1) Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG? 
  We find that manual transmission is better and that the difference using this dataset is statistically significant. 
  The parsimonious model for mpg uses engine weight, quarter mile time and automatic vs manual transmission as regressors. 
2) Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions. 
  Our model shows that changing from automatic to manual transmission improves mileage by about 2.9 mpg.

The R markdown does some exploratory data analysis, fits models to find the parsimonious model, reviews the model coefficients 
and the model residuals to confirm the results.

There are two versions of the R markdown: one for pdf output as specificed in the Johns Hopkins course assignment 
and another for html output that might be easier to read (as it does not follow the length constraints of the assignment).
